Twenty Seconds Curriculum Vitae in LaTex
========================================================================
# Curricula Vitae - Résumés
A curriculum vitae, otherwise known as a CV or résumé, is a document used by individuals to communicate their work history, education and skill set. This is a style template for your curriculum written in LaTex. The main goal of this template is to provide a curriculum that is able to survive to the résumés screening of "twenty seconds".

_The author assumes no responsibility for the topicality, correctness, completeness or quality of the information provided and for the obtained résumés._

This is designed for computer scientists but there is no limitation to use it for résumés in other disciplines.

##The basic idea is KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid.

In a nutshell _**"It is vain to do with more what can be done with fewer"**_ -- Occam's razor --

* **This template has been designed to create a "one-page" resume is therefore not suitable to create curriculum of more than one-page.** 

* _Please do not try to create curriculum more than one-page._ 

###How to describe your experiences?

There are many theories about the résumé screening process of "Big" companies.
Resume screeners and the interviewers look in your résumé for:

- Are you smart?
- Can you code (act for what you apply)?

Anyway according to the guidelines of this template you should use a really simple form to describe each items in your résumé: 

	Accomplished <X> by implementing <Y> which led to <Z>

Here's an examples:
	
	Reduced object rendering time by 75% by applying Floyd's algorithm, leading to a 10% reduction in system boot time.
